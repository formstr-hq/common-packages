# The Formstr Drive protocol, as actually implemented

**Ground truth:** [`formstr-hq/formstr-drive`](https://github.com/formstr-hq/formstr-drive) at
`0064bffcef4ecf73ae153894cce6a75b674f014d` (branch `feat/seekable-previews`, PR #72, top of the
stacked PRs #69–#72), read from source. Not from a README, not from the NIP text alone.

Everything below is what the app puts on the wire and what this SDK reads and writes. Each
section names the app function it mirrors. When upstream moves, diff against the pinned SHA and
update this file first, the codecs second (see ADR 0001).

---

## 1. Kind and event conventions

There is one kind: **`34578`**, addressable (replaceable per `pubkey` + `d`). What an event *is* is
its `t` tag.

| `t` | `d` | Encrypted to | Signed by | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `0:<identity pubkey>` | identity key (NIP-44 to self) | **identity** | the Drive Key |
| `files` | file id | Drive Key | Drive Key | file metadata |
| `folder` | folder id | Drive Key | Drive Key | folder metadata (SDK; the app has none) |
| `shared-file` | `s-<8 hex>` | ephemeral share key | Drive Key | a shared file |
| `container` | — | ephemeral share key | Drive Key | folder share — **read-only here, never written** |
| `shared-container` | `si-<8 hex>` | Drive Key | Drive Key | "Shared by me" bookkeeping |

Every event except the Drive Key event is built by `buildEvent` (`src/events.ts`), mirroring the
app's `sharing/event.ts`:

- **tags, in this order:** `["d", d]`, `["t", subtype]`, `["client", …]`, `["encrypted", "nip44"]`,
  then any extras (e.g. `["revoked", "1"]`).
- **content:** `nip44.v2.encrypt(JSON.stringify(payload), conversationKey)`. `nip44.v2` only — the
  `encrypted` tag and the cipher cannot drift.
- **conversation key** for a secret `s`: `nip44.v2.utils.getConversationKey(s, getPublicKey(s))`
  (encrypt to yourself).
- **`created_at`:** `nextCreatedAt()` — strictly increasing within a burst, clamped to `now + 60 s`
  (§8).

The Drive Key event is the exception: `[["d", "0:<pubkey>"], ["client", …]]`, encrypted by and signed
by the **identity** signer. The identity signer's only other job is Blossom authorization.

## 2. The Drive Key — `services/driveKey.ts`

Content, decrypted with the identity key. Three shapes are read, active key first:

```jsonc
{ "encryptionKey": "<64 hex>" }                                  // current, no history
{ "encryptionKey": "<64 hex>", "previousKeys": ["<64 hex>", …] }  // current, after rotation
[["encryptionKey", "<64 hex>"]]                                   // legacy array-of-tags
```

The SDK writes the first two (`previousKeys` omitted when empty). Malformed entries inside
`previousKeys` are skipped; a payload with no usable active key is unreadable.

**Keyring.** `active` = the active key of the newest readable event; `previous` = every other key
from every readable event, deduplicated, in encounter order. Newest = highest `created_at`, ties to
the lowest event id. File metadata is decrypted by trying each key; new events use `active`.

**Status** (`DriveKeyStatus`, mirrors the app's):

| | means |
|---|---|
| `ready` | a keyring was read (`stale: true` if the newest event carries fewer keys than are provably held) |
| `empty-confirmed` | no key exists, **proven**: identity has no history *and* every configured relay answered a control query |
| `unresolved` | anything else — timeout, unreachable relay, unreadable event, no way to prove coverage |

Rules that are the whole point (ADR 0003): a timeout is never empty; minting re-resolves uncached and
refuses unless `empty-confirmed`; rotation moves the old active key into `previousKeys`; no publish
may drop a known key.

Lookup: `observe([{kinds:[34578], authors:[identity], "#d":["0:<identity>"]}])`, held open for
`settleMs` (3 s) after the local EOSE — EOSE is the cache replay, not the network — up to `timeoutMs`
(20 s).

## 3. File metadata — `types/metadata.ts`, `services/fileIndex.ts`

**Written** (spec shape, strict — `fileSchema`):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "…", "unencryptedFileHash": "<64 hex>", "size": 0, "type": "text/plain",
  "parent": "<folder id, or empty for root>", "uploadedAt": 1700000000000,
  "servers": ["https://…"],              // where the blob actually landed
  "encryptionKey": "<64 hex>", "encryptionAlgorithm": "aes-gcm",
  "blobHash": "<64 hex>", "chunkSize": 65536, "previewHash": "<64 hex>?"
}
```

A tombstone is the same object plus `"deleted": true`, republished at the same `d`.

**Read** (lenient — `readFileMetadata`; ADR 0002): the spec shape and the app's shape (`folder` = path
string, `id`, `server`, `deleted`, optional `unencryptedFileHash`, and legacy `chunks`).

| App field | Read as |
|---|---|
| `server` (no `servers`) | `servers = [server]` |
| `folder` | `folderPath` (a path — never a parent id) |
| `deleted: true` | tombstone |
| `chunks` without `blobHash` | `legacyChunked` — lists, cannot download |

**Listings** key files by `d` alone, across every Drive Key pubkey: after a rotation the same file is
republished under the new key and replaces the old event. Newest `created_at` wins; equal timestamps go
to the lowest id (what relays keep). A tombstone hides the file and still blocks older versions. The
relay filter is `{kinds:[34578], authors:<all drive pubkeys>}` with **no** `#t` — legacy events may lack
the tag — and other subtypes are skipped client-side by their `t`.

**Folders:** `{ "name", "parent" }`, `t=folder`, same rules.

## 4. NIP-FS single blob — `crypto.ts`, `services/downloadFile.ts`, `rangeRead.ts`

One blob per file: every segment's ciphertext concatenated in order. `blobHash` = sha256 of the blob.

- Key: the file's `encryptionKey` secret → NIP-44 self conversation key (32 bytes), used **directly** as
  the AES-256-GCM key. No HKDF.
- Segment `i` of `n = max(1, ceil(size / chunkSize))`: plaintext is `chunkSize` bytes, the last is
  `size − chunkSize·(n−1)` (possibly 0). Ciphertext = `ct ‖ tag(16)`. No version byte, no stored nonce.
- Nonce (12 bytes): 11-byte big-endian segment index, then `0x01` on the last segment else `0x00`.
  An index that does not fit in 11 bytes is an error.
- Frame length is `chunkSize + 16`, except the last: `size − chunkSize·(n−1) + 16`. Blob size is
  `size + 16·n`.
- **Stream decode:** read frames over arbitrary network chunking; a short read is
  `BlobTruncatedError`; bytes after the last frame are `BlobOverrunError`; `unencryptedFileHash`, if
  present, is verified incrementally (`IntegrityError`).
- **Range decode:** ciphertext bytes `[first·(chunkSize+16), min(blobSize, (last+1)·(chunkSize+16)) − 1]`
  cover plaintext `[start, end]`. `isLast` means the **file's** last segment. A `200` (server ignored
  `Range`) is never decoded — `RangeNotSatisfiedError`.

## 5. Blossom — `blossom.ts`

| | |
|---|---|
| upload | `PUT {server}/upload`, `X-SHA-256`, BUD-02 `Authorization` (kind 24242, `t=upload`, `x=<blobHash>`) |
| preflight | `HEAD {server}/upload` with `X-Content-Length`, `X-Content-Type`, `X-SHA-256` (BUD-06) |
| download | `GET {server}/{hash}`; optional `Range: bytes=a-b` (`206` = honored) |
| exists | `HEAD {server}/{hash}` — `200` yes, `404` no, else *uncertain* (throws) |
| delete | `DELETE {server}/{hash}`, BUD-02 `t=delete`; `404` counts as success |

**Preflight classification** (`canAccept`): only **403, 413, 415** are refusals. 404 and 501 mean BUD-06
is not implemented (verified against live servers that 404 the probe and accept the PUT); 429 and 5xx
are transient per BUD-06; a timeout says nothing. All of those proceed to the real PUT.

Upload: one authorization, replayed across servers. `fallback` stops at the first server that accepts;
`replicate` tries all. Up to 3 attempts per server; 401/403/413/415 are never retried. `servers` in the
metadata lists only servers the blob landed on, and at least one must succeed.

## 6. Sharing — `services/sharing/*`

**Link:** `#shared=<naddr>&k=<64 hex>`. `naddr` = NIP-19 `{kind: 34578, pubkey: <drive pubkey>,
identifier: <d>, relays: [...]}`. The ephemeral secret rides outside it (`naddr` has no TLV for one) and
the fragment is never sent to a server. The link does not say file-or-folder — the fetched event's own
`t` tag does. Decoding returns `null`, never throws, on a malformed link, a `k` that is not 64 hex, or an
naddr of another kind. A full URL containing the fragment is accepted.

**Create** (`createFileShare`): generate an ephemeral secret; publish `t=shared-file`, `d=s-<8 hex>`,
payload = the file's own decrypted JSON, encrypted to the ephemeral key, signed by the Drive Key. Relay
hints in the link are the relays in the publish result whose status is `accepted` — never an assumed
default set. Then write the bookkeeping event.

**Bookkeeping** (`t=shared-container`, `d=si-<8 hex>`, encrypted to the Drive Key), written for file
shares too:

```jsonc
{ "v": 1, "kind": "file", "name": "…", "source": { "type": "file", "id": "<file id>" },
  "coordinate": "34578:<drive pubkey>:s-…", "relays": ["wss://…"], "members": [],
  "encryptionKey": "<ephemeral secret hex>", "revokedAt": 1700000000 /* once revoked */ }
```

`listShares` decrypts these with the keyring, keeps the newest per `d`, rebuilds each link from
`coordinate` + `relays` + `encryptionKey`. Revoked entries stay listed.

**Resolve** (`resolveShare`): `observe({relays})` with the link's hints (per call; no global routing),
newest event at the coordinate wins; `t=container` → `FolderShareUnsupportedError`; a `["revoked","1"]`
tag short-circuits **before** decrypting; otherwise decrypt with the link key and read the file
metadata. An authenticated revoke payload also reads as revoked.

**Revoke** (`revokeShare`): a superseding event with the same `d` and `t`, encrypted to the same
ephemeral key, tag `["revoked","1"]`, `created_at` strictly newer than the original, payload
`{"v":1,"revoked":true,"at":<unix s>,"kind":"file"}`, signed by the Drive Key that authored the share.
Then rewrite the bookkeeping event with `revokedAt`, and send a best-effort NIP-09 request for the share
coordinate. Revoking cannot un-disclose anything a recipient already fetched.

**Ensure** (`ensureFileShare`): idempotent. A live (non-revoked) bookkeeping entry for the same file id
returns its link; otherwise create. Concurrent calls for one file share one in-flight request.

## 7. Deletion and republish

Rename and move republish the same `d` with `created_at = max(nextCreatedAt(), previous + 1)`, encrypted
and signed by the **active** key (even if the old event was authored by a rotated key — listings key by
`d`).

`deleteFile`: (1) tombstone republish — must land, or nothing else happens; (2) NIP-09 kind 5 with
`["a", "34578:<active pubkey>:<id>"]` and `["k","34578"]`, best effort; (3) best-effort blob delete on
each of the file's servers, skipping every hash in the caller's `stillReferenced` set. See ADR 0004 for
why that set must come from a complete index.

## 8. Timestamps — `clock.ts`

`nextCreatedAt` is one shared monotonic clock for every addressable publish. Relays break equal-timestamp
ties on a replaceable event by lowest id, so back-to-back publishes at one coordinate would be a coin
flip. Each stamp is therefore strictly greater than the last — until it would run more than 60 s ahead of
the wall clock (formstr-drive #71 review): a far-future stamp baked into a signed event beats another
device's legitimate real-time edit. So after 61 stamps inside one second the value holds at `now + 60`
(non-decreasing, no longer strictly increasing). Republishes that must beat a specific event
(rename, revoke, key rotation) also take `max(…, replaced.created_at + 1)`.

## 9. What is not here

Folder sharing, service-worker wiring, transfer queues, a persistent index, a durable outbox, preview
generation, BUD-03 discovery: ADR 0004.

## 10. Interop verification

What the SDK writes — share links and events, revoke and bookkeeping events, Drive Key events, uploaded
metadata — is decoded in `test/interop.test.ts` and `test/sharing.test.ts` with stock `nostr-tools`
(`nip19.decode`, `nip44.v2.decrypt`) and no SDK code. What it reads is tested against both the spec shape
and the app's shape, including all three Drive Key payload shapes, tombstones and legacy chunked files.
There is no automated check against output generated by the app's own code (see ADR 0001); re-diff the
app against the pinned SHA before a release.
